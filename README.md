Data analysis of Power to Change grants for climate and ecological action

### Broad approach for PtC grant data:
1. Reviewed taxonomy/categories of climate and ecological action with justification
2. Data cleaning/prep of all PtC grants data
3. Tagged data using taxonomy to create climate and ecological action dataset
4. Excluded most pubs and community halls
5. Analysis of the climate and ecological action dataset

### Key Project Findings:
1. PtC funding for climate action: £18.2 million
2. Mostly in buildings, food, transport and energy
3. More specifically: energy efficiency, housing, energy generation and storage 
4. Most funding to Yorkshire and Humber, North West and South West regions 
5. Climate funding is highly focused on funding most deprived areas
6. Time series trends: increasing, particularly since 2018 and C-19
7. Climate related funding represents 19 percent of PtC’s grant funding 
8. PtC 3rd biggest funder of climate action grants
